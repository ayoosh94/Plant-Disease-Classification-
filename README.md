# Potato Leaf Disease Classification using Image Recognition

## Overview

Potatoes rank as the 4th most essential staple food worldwide and are cultivated in a staggering 95 countries. However, it's disheartening to know that about 32% of potato crops are lost each year due to diseases and pests. There are various diseases afflict potatoes, such as common scabs, black dots, silver scurf, etc. However, our main focus revolves around two particularly severe diseases: early blight and late blight. 

## Solution

We are building three models in order to solve this problem. These three are SVM, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The final output is taken by stack ensembling these three models by training a logistic regression classifier.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to train a machine learning model using a dataset of labeled potato leaf images to accurately classify them into different disease categories. By leveraging techniques like data augmentation during training, we improve the model's performance and mitigate overfitting. Once trained, the model can be used for inference to classify unseen potato leaf images into their respective disease categories.

## Dataset

The data set is taken from the Kaggle data sets. A dataset consisting of labeled images of potato leaves, where each image is annotated with the corresponding disease category. The dataset should cover a variety of diseases that commonly affect potato leaves, such as late blight and early blight

## Future Scope

In the future, we envision expanding the application of this model to other plants, thereby increasing production efficiency and fostering economic growth in the agricultural sector. Additionally, we aim to develop and implement AI-based applications that utilize cameras for farmers to enable easy identification of diseases in different plants.

Your contributions and feedback are most welcome! Let's join hands to enhance crop management and reduce economic losses in agriculture.
