# Potato Leaf Disease Classification using Image Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on potato plant disease detection, aiming to address the economic losses faced by potato farmers due to various diseases. The two primary diseases of concern are early blight, caused by a fungus, and late blight, caused by a specific micro-organism. Early and accurate detection of these diseases can lead to appropriate treatment, potentially saving significant waste and economic losses.

## Solution

To prevent economic losses, we have created an image classification model that can accurately recognize diseases in potato plants. The model can specifically identify early blight and late blight, allowing farmers to apply targeted treatments for each disease.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to train a machine learning model using a dataset of labelled potato leaf images to accurately classify them into different disease categories. By leveraging techniques like data augmentation during training, we improve the model's performance and mitigate overfitting. Once trained, the model can be used for inference to classify unseen potato leaf images into their respective disease categories.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and validation is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of labelled images of potato leaves, with each image annotated to indicate the corresponding disease category. The dataset encompasses a variety of diseases that commonly affect potato leaves, such as late blight and early blight.

## Future Scope

In the future, we envision expanding the application of this model to other plants, thereby increasing production efficiency and fostering economic growth in the agricultural sector. Additionally, we aim to develop and implement AI-based applications that utilize cameras for farmers to enable easy identification of diseases in different plants.

Your contributions and feedback are most welcome! Let's join hands to enhance crop management and reduce economic losses in agriculture.
